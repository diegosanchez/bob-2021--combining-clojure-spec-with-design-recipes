# Expected Results
    
- Detection of underlying logical inconsistencies and incoherencies within our domain model (both within and across its entities) *during the data specification step*.
<!--
(The) Domain Model > The whole Set of Entities
 -->
-  Automated and comprehensive enforcing of properties across the whole domain model *during the specification process*.
- Comprehensive verification of inferred-but-not-explicit properties across the domain model. <!-- that would normally be detected only after the system has gone into staging/production --> _(E.g.: trx vs. ride-cost.)_
- Automated generation of test data for function exercising.
